# Machine Learning Tasks - repository
This repository contains solution of some tasks from book 
*An introduction to Statistical Learning* and tasks suggested during 
machine learning classes during medical computer science course at 
AGH University of Science and Technology. 

## Scope of classes
### Regression
- regression model parameters estimation
- MSE estimation and other statistics
- p-value testing for model parameters
- Regression models with torch and SGD optimization

### Classification

- classifiers: Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, Gaussian Bayes and KNN 
- MNIST digits data set classification (with HOG)
- multilabel and multinomial classification
- well known statistics calculation (such as ROC area)
- model parameters optimization with Optuna

### ResamplingMethods

- Monte Carlo Methods
- Bootstrap Methods
- Permutation Methods (for correlated and uncorrelated data)
- Cross-Validation
